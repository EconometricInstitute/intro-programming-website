Throughout our course, we have been using various built-in classes available in the Java programming language. These include classes like `Scanner`, `List`, and `String`. We have become accustomed to working with these classes and have learned how to use some of the methods they provide.

These classes can come in handy when building a program that requires the user to input movies in their library and store them in a collection. Before we begin, let us take a look at the `Movie` class:

``` java
public class Movie {
    private String title;
    private int length;

    public Movie(String title, int length) {
        this.title = title;
        this.length = length;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
        return this.title;
    }

    public int getLength() {
        return this.length;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return this.title + " (" + this.length + "m)";
    }
}
```

Moreover, let us add a `MovieCollection` class that allows to store a number of movies:
``` java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class MovieCollection {
    private String name;
    private List<Movie> movies;

    public MovieCollection(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.movies = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    public void addMovie(Movie movie) {
        this.movies.add(movie);
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public String toString() {
        if (movies.isEmpty()) {
            return "Collection " + this.name + " is currently empty";
        } else {
            return "Collection " + this.name + " has the movies: " + this.movies;
        }
    }
}
```

Moreover, we can create the following class that asks the user for the movies in his database and then adds them to a `MovieCollection` object:
``` java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

MovieCollection collection = new MovieCollection("My collection");

System.out.println("Please give the movies that you own below.");
while (true) {
    System.out.println("Give the title of the next movie (empty will end the program)");
    String movieName = scanner.nextLine();

    if (movieName.isEmpty()) {
        break;
    }

    System.out.println("Give the length of the movie in minutes");
    int movieLength = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

    collection.addMovie(new Movie(movieName, movieLength));
}

System.out.println("Your current movie collection is:");
System.out.println(collection);
```

Note how we have utilized various methods provided by the built-in Java classes in this code snippet. For instance, we have employed the `nextLine` method of the `Scanner` class to retrieve user input, the `add` method of the `List` class to add elements to the list, and the parameterized constructor of the `String` class to create a new string object enclosed in double quotes.

## The Java class library
If we want to include the release date for each movie, one approach is to create our own class to store the date. However, the `Java class library` already provides functionality for many common use cases. This library includes all the classes that are available by default in Java.

Documentation of all the classes and methods that are available within the library can be found [online](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/module-summary.html). When we use the search functionality, we can for example find the documentation for [Scanner](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Scanner.html), [String](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) and [List](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/List.html). Note how the documentation provides documentation on all the methods that are offered by a certain class, such as the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Scanner.html#nextLine()) for the `nextLine()` method of the `Scanner` class.

When dealing with time related functionality, the `java.time` part of the Java class library can, for example, be of great use. The [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/package-summary.html) for this part of the library tells us more about the classes that are available to use. When we read through this page, we see that the `LocalDate` class allows us to store a date, which is exactly what we need to store a release date.

Let us now extend the `Movie` class to also store the release date:
``` java
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Movie {
    private String title;
    private int length;
    private LocalDate releaseDate;

    public Movie(String title, int length, LocalDate releaseDate) {
        this.title = title;
        this.length = length;
        this.releaseDate = releaseDate;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
        return this.title;
    }

    public int getLength() {
        return this.length;
    }

    public LocalDate getReleaseDate() {
        return this.releaseDate;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return this.title + " (" + this.length + "m)" + ", " + this.releaseDate;
    }
}
```

<programming-exercise name="Substring">

Write a method `public static String firstPartOfString(String string)` that returns a string with the first three characters of the passed String. When the program is called as:

`` java
  System.out.println(firstPartOfString("long"));
  System.out.println(firstPartOfString("hi"));
``

the output of the program should be:

<sample-output>

lon
hi

</sample-output>

Hint: check the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html) of the `String` class for a method that returns a part of a given string.

</programming-exercise>

## Static methods
When looking at the [documentation]() for the `LocalDate` class, we can observe that no constructors are given. This is because `LocalDate` objects are created by means of a `static` method. As discussed before, `static` methods are not part of an object of the class, but instead belong directly to the class. For this reason, we often refer to `static` methods as `static methods`, while methods that are not `static` are referred to as `instance methods`. These terms can also be found in the documentation.

We have already seen one example in which we used a static method to create an object, namely for lists. Here, we used the `List.of` method to create a list containing certain elements. Note how we are using `List` here to refer to the `List` class and then use a dot to indicate that we want to access a `static` method of this class. Similarly, we use the `LocalDate.of` method to create a `LocalDate` object. The documentation of this method is given [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/LocalDate.html#of(int,int,int)).

Our code to read the movies from the user and print them now looks as follows:
``` java
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

MovieCollection collection = new MovieCollection("My collection");

System.out.println("Please give the movies that you own below.");
while (true) {
    System.out.println("Give the title of the next movie (empty will end the program)");
    String movieName = scanner.nextLine();

    if (movieName.isEmpty()) {
        break;
    }

    System.out.println("Give the length of the movie in minutes");
    int movieLength = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

    System.out.println("Give the release year:");
    int year = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

    System.out.println("Give the release month:");
    int month = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

    System.out.println("Give the release day:");
    int day = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());

    LocalDate releaseDate = LocalDate.of(year, month, day);

    collection.addMovie(new Movie(movieName, movieLength, releaseDate));
}

System.out.println("Your current movie collection is:");
System.out.println(collection);
```

An example of running our program is given by:

<sample-output>

Please give the movies that you own below.
Give the title of the next movie (empty will end the program)
**Tarzan**
Give the length of the movie in minutes
**88**
Give the release year:
**1999**
Give the release month:
**6**
Give the release day:
**16**
Give the title of the next movie (empty will end the program)
**Lion King**
Give the length of the movie in minutes
**88**
Give the release year:
**1994**
Give the release month:
**6**
Give the release day:
**24**
Give the title of the next movie (empty will end the program)

Your current movie collection is:
Collection My collection has the movies: [Tarzan (88m, 1999-06-16), Lion King (88m, 1994-06-24)]

</sample-output>

<programming-exercise name="Calendar">

Write a `Calendar` class that is able to store dates. The class should have:
- A constructor without any parameters
- A method `public void addDate(LocalDate date)` which adds a date to the Calendar
- A method `public void print()` that prints the dates in the Calendar. See the usage below for the format of printing. Moreover, it should print the text `Calendar is empty` if there are no dates in the calendar.
- A method `public LocalDate getLatestDate()` which returns the last date (in time) on the Calendar. If no date is present in the calendar, return `null`

The usage of this class should looks as follows:
``` java
Calendar calendar = new Calendar();
calendar.addDate(LocalDate.of(2019,2,5));
calendar.addDate(LocalDate.of(2020, 3, 8));
calendar.addDate(LocalDate.of(2020, 8,1));

calendar.print();

System.out.println("The latest date is: " + calendar.getLatestDate());
```

<sample-output>

Dates in the calendar are:
2019-02-05
2020-03-08
2020-08-01
The latest date is: 2020-08-01

</sample-output>

Hint: Look at the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/LocalDate.html) of the `LocalDate` class to see how it is used.

## Javadoc comments
Java class documentation is generated using the `Javadoc` tool. Javadoc comments are multi-line comments placed in specific parts of the code, such as on top of a class, instance variables, constructors, or methods. The tool uses these comments to generate the documentation.

In addition to regular comments, Javadoc comments use special tags to provide additional information about the class, method, or variable.

For example, let's consider the `MovieCollection` class we created earlier. Here is how the class would look with Javadoc comments:
``` java
/**
 * A class that represents a movie collection and thus allows to store movies.
 */
public class MovieCollection {
    private String name;
    private List<Movie> movies;

    /**
     * Initializes an empty movie collection with a given name.
     *
     * @param name the name of the movie collection
     */
    public MovieCollection(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.movies = new ArrayList<>();
    }

    /**
     * Adds a movie to the collection.
     *
     * @param movie the movie that should be added.
     */
    public void addMovie(Movie movie) {
        this.movies.add(movie);
    }

    /**
     * Gives the name of the collection
     *
     * @return the name of the collection
     */
    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    /**
     * Gives a string representation of the object that shows the name of the collection and the movies contained in
     * it.
     *
     * @return a string representation of the object
     */
    public String toString() {
        if (movies.isEmpty()) {
            return "Collection " + this.name + " is currently empty";
        } else {
            return "Collection " + this.name + " has the movies: " + this.movies;
        }
    }
}
```

The multiline comments added above the class, constructor, and methods in the `MovieCollection` class provide a clear understanding of their purpose. This allows users to know what each method does without having to look at its implementation. Special characters are:
- `@param` followed by a parameter name, to indicate what each parameter in the method indicates
- `@return` to indicate what is returned from a method

Javadoc comments have two main advantages. Firstly, they can be used by someone reading the code to understand what the class and methods are supposed to do, effectively serving as documentation for the code. Secondly, documentation pages can be generated from the code using the `Tools > Generate JavaDoc` option.
