## Computer Programs
Programming is the process of writing `source code` to tell a computer what to do. The source code is translated into basic instructions that the computer's processor can execute. These instructions, or steps, make up a `computer program`. Programming languages, such as `Java`, provide commands and methods for writing code, allowing for the use of higher level functions and methods. In this course, we will focus on the `Java` programming language, which is widely used.


## Characteristics of Java
Java is a widely used programming language that belongs to the class of object-oriented languages, in which objects provide a useful way to organize and think about code. We will delve deeper into these objects in week 5 of this course. Other popular object-oriented languages include C++, C#, and Python. These languages, including Java, consistently rank in the [top 10 of most popular programming languages](https://octoverse.github.com/#top-languages). Knowing Java will give you a strong foundation for learning other popular programming languages.

One key factor in Java's popularity is that it is platform-independent, meaning that a Java program can be run on any operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) without modification. This is made possible by the `Java Virtual Machine (JVM)`, which converts the source code into a format (`bytecode`) that the computer can understand. This allows for easy sharing and running of code across different platforms.

## This course
In this course, you will become familiar with some of the most important concepts of Java.
In essence, our aim is that you will be able to write simple Java programs after this course that you can use during your studies.
Moreover, this will provide you with a first stepping stone to learn more advanced programming concepts, either in follow-up courses or by self-study.

<text-box variant='learningObjectives' name='Summary'>
In this part, we have 
  
  - learned about the process of programming. The key thing to remember is that a `program` is made by writing `source code` that is written in a `programming language`, and translated to `basic instructions` for the computer to process.

- learned about the main characteristics of Java. Its key features are its object-oriented design, popularity, and platform-independence.
