Support for this course will mainly be provided through scheduled sessions. For an overview of when the sessions take place, see the [online timetable](https://timetables.eur.nl/schedule). Moreover, additional help can be obtained by posting questions on the course `Canvas Discussion Board` page.


### Lecture
Each week starts with a 2-hour lecture. This lecture will consist of multiple components:
- General announcements
- Discussion of the topics of the week
- Live programming demonstration 
- Q&A session (using padlet)

### Tutorials
Each week there is a tutorial, where there will be a TA present to help you with questions regarding the practice exercises, homework assignments, or any general questions about the material. The idea is that you will work on the exercises during the tutorial. However, it is expected that you have already worked on the material of the week and prepared some questions. The tutorials will take place on campus. Though depending on the circumstances, they may partially take place through  `Microsoft Teams` or `Zoom`. In the first week, we plan to offer some additional support to help everyone get started.

### Q&A Session
At the end of the week, there is a 1-hour Q&A session. This Q&A session is intended to help answer questions regarding the course content and setup. The Q&A session is not intended to help you with your homework assignments.

### Discussion Board
If additional question pop up, that you were not be able to ask during the question hour or tutorial sessions, you can ask them on the `Canvas Discussion Board` of the course. We will try to regularly check the discussion board and answer any questions that pop-up. Note that if you ask a question here, all students in the course can see it and benefit from the answer. However, this also means that you have to make sure not to include any personal information or any part of a solution for an assignment in these questions.

### Email
For any personal matters you should [send an email](mailto:feb21011@ese.eur.nl). Email is not intended for asking questions about the assignments or content of the course: such emails will be ignored.
