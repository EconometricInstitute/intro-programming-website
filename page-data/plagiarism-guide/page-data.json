Relating to use of the internet, this can sometimes be confusing. When programming in a 'normal' setting, it is extremely common to use the internet as a source: why would you spend hours trying to solve a problem, if someone else has already solved it for you? </p>\n<p>During a programming course, this is unfortunately a problem because you will learn how to solve such problems. This won't happen if you simply copy (important parts of) your solution from the internet. On the other hand, we do want you to also learn to use the internet as a source when programming.</p>\n<h3>Rule of thumb</h3>\n<p>For the reasons mentioned above, we provide you with the following rule of thumb: </p>\n<p><strong>You are allowed to use the internet / fellow students / 'others' to help you understand Java or programming in general, but you are not allowed to use them to obtain (partial) solutions to the graded assignments.</strong></p>\n<p>For example, suppose we ask you to write a program that solves a Sudoku puzzle, then:</p>\n<p><strong>NOT OK:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>asking someone for help to make a sudoku solver </li>\n<li>googling something like 'sudoku solver java' / 'sudoku in java'</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>OK:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>asking a TA / teacher for tips on how to get started with making a sudoku solver</li>\n<li>asking someone else how you can store numbers in a 2D grid in java</li>\n<li>googling 'looping over rows of array java'</li>\n<li>looking up the rules of sudoku</li>\n<li>asking someone else for a clarification of the exercise (but be careful here!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What if you get stuck?</h3>\n<p>If you get stuck with a graded assignment, you have two options: you can ask a TA during the practicals or post on the discussion board.
